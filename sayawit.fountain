INT. ROOM - NIGHT
A dimly lit room. A single candle flickers, casting shadows on the worn wooden walls. RIZAL, his brows furrowed in deep thought, writes fervently at a small table, his quill scratching against parchment. Outside, muffled gunfire and distant cries echo—the battle between Filipinos and Spaniards rages on.

RIZAL
(V.O)
Mga kababayan, hanggang kailan tayo magpapasailalim?
Hanggang kailan natin titiisin ang pang-aapi?
Dumadaloy ang dugo ng ating mga kapatid, hindi dahil sa kasalanan, kundi sa pagnanais lumaya!

RIZAL
(V.O)
Hindi tayo isinilang upang maging alipin!
Ang ating bayan ay may dangal at sariling tinig!
Ang panulat ay mas matalas kaysa sa espada!

RIZAL
(V.O)
Kung mamatay ako, ipagpatuloy ninyo!
Ang tagumpay ay wala sa armas, kundi sa diwang hindi kayang bihagin!
Darating ang araw—magiging malaya tayo!

Rizal grips his letter, his eyes burning with resolve. Then he slams the table.

The song begins.

INT. ROOM - NIGHT

The actors will go into the center in a formation getting ready for the dance. The background will be the lyrics of the song.

Actors Bow first

TEODORA
(V.O)
Our little curious boy
Is coming home from playing about
I've a bunch of letters
To let him read and write his thoughts out
Smiling in astonishment
The weather warmer, he is bolder
Teaching him the way of man
To see him grow bright and older

ACTORS
Teodora he is just a boy

TEODORA
But he has reached so many as a little boy

ACTORS
Teodora he is now grown

TEODORA
But does he have to go so far away from home

ACTORS
Teodora he's a bright man

TEODORA
But he didn't even made it to his thirties
I miss him so, my little bright
Oh, I miss him so, my grown wise boy

INT. ROOM - NIGHT

There is a gathering of the katipunan members and the leader is giving a speech to their members.

A Katipunan leader steps forward, holding his cedula high as the other Katipuneros gather, torches flickering in the night. His voice rises above the tension, filled with fire and conviction.

KATIPUNAN LEADER
Mga kapatid, ito ang huling gabi ng ating pagiging alipin! Ang sedulang ito—hindi ito papel lamang.

KATIPUNAN LEADER
Ito ay sagisag ng ating pagkakadena, ng ating pagbabayad sa dayuhang walang ibang ginawa kundi tapakan ang ating dangal!
Bawat titik dito ay tanda ng kanilang pang-aalipin! Bawat bayad ay isang latay sa ating pagkatao!

KATIPUNAN LEADER
Kaya ngayong gabi, sa harap ng apoy at ng ating panata, pinupunit natin hindi lang ang sedula—pinupunit natin ang ating takot!

KATIPUNAN LEADER
Pinupunit natin ang ating tanikala! At mula sa abo nito, isisilang ang isang bansang hindi na yuyuko, hindi na magpapasakop, at hindi na magpapabayad sa sarili niyang lupa!"

KATIPUNAN LEADER
Mga Kapatid!
Punitin ang sedula!!!

(He rips his cedula in half and throws it to the flames. One by one, the Katipuneros do the same, their voices rising in a chant of freedom as the flames consume the remnants of their oppression.)

TEODORA
Tears from the wide news
Oh, St. Joseph, he wasn't at fault
Exiled through four years
He couldn't win from the allegations
Spare my kid from faults at him
And give him all your logical whims
Now he's sitting in his hole
He might as well have written his woes

ACTORS
(What could he do? Should have stayed silent)

TEODORA
But he was only speaking for Filipinos

ACTORS
(What did they do? They were colonizers)

TEODORA
But they did so much harm to Filipinos

ACTORS
(What could we do? We were only slave)

TEODORA
But he united us Filipinos
What a waste, National Hero
Oh, what a waste of our national hero
Oh, what a waste of all them national heroes
National Hero
National Hero~

BGM MUSIC STILL PLAYS:

INT. Luneta Park - DAY
Suddenly, while still singing, soldiers seize RIZAL, forcefully preparing him for execution.

The SOLDIER LEADER steps forward, raising his voice.

SOLDIER LEADER
(commanding)
¡Preparen! (Prepare!)

The soldiers step forward, raising their rifles, their hands trembling slightly.

SOLDIER LEADER
¡Carguen! (Load!)

The soldiers load their rifles.

SOLDIER LEADER
¡Apunten! (Aim!)

RIZAL
"Consummatum est." (it is done)

SOLDIER LEADER
¡Fuego! (Fire!)

A deafening volley of gunfire erupts. Rizal collapses, his body falling in slow motion.

As the final gunshots fade, silence takes over.

RIZALs body lies motionless on the ground. A soft gasp is heard—TEODORA ALONSO, his mother, rushes forward, her trembling hands reaching for her fallen son.

Teodora pushes the soldiers and head towards RIZAL,

TEODORA
Tabi!, Tabi!.

She kneels beside him, gently lifting his lifeless body into her arms. Tears stream down her face as she cradles him, rocking slightly, calling his name.


TEODORA(soft, broken voice)
José… anak ko…
